# FPS in C++
A FPS maze walking with C++ over the Microsoft Windows Console

To run the .exe properly, please install C++ or Visual Studio in your computer, because it needs the C++ libraries.
Also, don't maximize the terminal windows of the .exe file, neither use it on full screen, the main definition is 120x40 cause it's made over the console without any graphic library for now.

Enjoy!
